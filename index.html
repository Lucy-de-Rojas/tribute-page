      <h3>Water Facts:</h3>
      <ul>
        
        <li>There is the same amount of <span class="water">water</span> on Earth as there was when the Earth was formed. The <span class="water">water</span> from your faucet could contain molecules that dinosaurs drank.</li>
        <li>Nearly 97% of the world’s <span class="water">water</span> is salty or otherwise undrinkable. Another 2% is locked in ice caps and glaciers.
        That leaves just 1% for all of humanity’s needs — all its agricultural, residential, manufacturing, community, and personal needs.</li>
        <li><span class="water">Water</span> regulates the Earth’s temperature. It also regulates the temperature of the human body, carries nutrients and oxygen to cells, cushions joints, protects organs and tissues, and removes wastes.</li>
        <li>75% of the human brain is <span class="water">water</span> and 75% of a living tree is <span class="water">water</span>.</li>
        <li>A person can live about a month without food, but only about a week without <span class="water">water</span>.</li>
        <li>What we pour on the ground ends up in our <span class="water">water</span>, and what we spew into the sky ends up in our <span class="water">water</span>.</li>
    
        
        <li><span class="water">Water</span> expands by 9% when it freezes. Frozen <span class="water">water</span> (ice) is lighter than <span class="water">water</span>, which is why ice floats in <span class="water">water</span>.</li>
